# containers


As part of the project you need to write your own library that implements the basic standard C++ container classes: `list`, `map`, `queue`, `set`, `stack` and `vector`. Implementations should provide a full set of standard methods and attributes for element handling, container capacity checking and iteration. As a bonus, you can also implement several other container classes from the C++ container library that are not as commonly used, but differ in their implementation details.

- The program must be developed in C++ language of C++17 standard using gcc compiler
- The program code must be located in the src folder
- When writing code it is necessary to follow the Google style
- Make sure to use iterators
- Classes must be template
- Classes must be implemented within the `s21` namespace
- Prepare full coverage of container classes methods with unit-tests using the GTest library
- Copying of the Standard Template Library (STL) implementation is not allowed
- The logic of the Standard Template Library (STL) must be followed (in terms of checks, memory handling and behaviour in abnormal situations)
